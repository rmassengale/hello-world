Learning the ropes

Hey Everybody,

I'm completely new at this, so please forgive my errors and misspeakings. I'm starting down this road initially to learn how to work bots
and other things of that nature for a Pokemon Go Discord server I'm running. Roll your eyes that's fine, but everyone starts somewhere 
and that server is what's getting me started. I'm not just looking to make it better for me though, I'm doing it for the local Pogo community.  We're in a rural area and need all the help we can get when it comes to this game. I'm not looking to spoof, or snipe, but getting notifications of things on the server like spawns and raids would be helpful....Anyhow, once I get a good handle on this, I'm sure there are other areas in my life where the tools I pick up here will be useful. Glad to meet you!
